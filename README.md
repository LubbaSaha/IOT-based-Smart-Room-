# INTERNEt Of THINGs : Raspberry Pi Home automation System based on IoT

<img src = "images/GetBannerImage.ashx.jpeg">

Home automation system will control lighting, climate, entertainment systems, and appliances. It may also include home security such as access control and alarm systems. Moreover we have placed sensors like temperature , light and PIR to record conditions of surroundings and can take decision based on that data, automatically. 

We can control home appliances via phone from anywhere in the world or let it get controlled automatically. 

## Architecture

This Project can be divided into 3 modules as shown :

* End User(Phone)
* Raspberry Pi End (Home appliances)
* Server/Cloud (via which both part can communicate)

### User End

The interface for user end is made using python's kivy framework. User can control appliances manually using the mobile/desktop application in manual mode or can let them get controlled automatically in automatic mode.

Some glimpses of our user end :
